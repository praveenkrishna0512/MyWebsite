//         "It was 2019. I was on my way to interview for a scholarship. Won’t say I felt very prepared, but I was calm. I greeted my interviewers and it began. I was able to answer most of the questions posed but as we got to the end, the interviewer asked me.",
//         "“Tell me more about your leadership experience.”",
//         "Having held a few leadership positions in high school, I went on about how I organized meetings, met the team’s objectives and so on. The interview then replied.",
//         "“You have listed a lot of your organizational skills. But tell me more about your leadership experience.”",
//         "I was stunned. I thought I knew what leadership was all about. Turns out I didn’t, and I just stared at the interviewer because I didn’t know how to answer.",
//         "Looking back now, there has been a lot of growth in my life over the past 3 years. And I am very glad to have had the privilege to hone my leadership capabilities. These are some of the experiences that have contributed to who I am today.",
//         "Going through command school in the SAF exposed me to great peers who I admire and look up to. They ignited the spark within me to become a better leader. My experiences training and leading in SAF as a whole shed light on my flaws and insecurities as a leader — it was one of the lowest points in my lives, but also one I am ever grateful for. For those moments led me on a journey of self-awareness and growth.",
//         "Soon after NS, I joined Access Singapore. Starting off as a Programmes Associate, it has now been more than 6 months since I took up the responsibility to lead the Programmes team. Access acted as a testbed for my leadership — a way to continually reflect, assess my current strengths and weaknesses, and aim for higher growth. There have been a lot of learnings and thoughts throughout this almost 2 year journey with Access; it will be getting a separate post soon.",
//         "Earlier this year, I decided to enroll myself in a leadership course in NUS named IT2900 Technical Management & Leadership. Imagine if the university freed up 4MCs worth of your time, for you to just think. Think deeper about who you are and what you hope to achieve as a leader. That was IT2900 for me. Listening to the stories of leaders in the industry. Learning about frameworks and concepts to analyse and approach conflict resolution. Inspiring others. IT2900 provided me with the space to reflect and the tools to apply in leadership positions I hold. Some would call the module fluffy, and even our Prof would say that the module is simply stating the obvious. But sometimes reminders of the obvious are what we need to keep us on the track of healthy growth. To serve as anchors when we may lead ourselves astray.",
//         "A huge shoutout to Prof Ben for coordinating the module and sharing your life experiences in intriguing ways. Special thanks to the TAs Shamantha and Shane too, for enabling this journey of self-discovery. Your tutorials were a time for me to take a step back from the hustle, to relax and reflect. So I will dearly miss attending them.",
//         "These are just some notable experiences that have shaped who I am today. There are many other influences that are shaping me to be who I am today. Some of the friends I have met in university have been blessings, for their knowledge, support and mentorships. Some of whom are the closest friends I have today. The amount I have learnt from those around me is indescribable, and I will always be grateful to have chanced upon them.",
//         "I now know that leadership is more than just organizing meetings and hitting team objectives. It’s about the ability to rally a team towards a cause. It’s about resolving inevitable conflicts that arise within and across teams. It’s about maintaining morale when setbacks occur. It’s about so much more that I likely have yet to experience in my current leadership journey.",
//         "I am still far from the perfect leader, and I am making mistakes almost everyday. But I will forever be thankful to even have the ability to embark on this journey of self-discovery and improvement, supported by friends and family along the way. Hoping to make my impact in this world one day.",

//         "Finally, my personal website is up! While I have worked on React based websites before, this is the first time I am building one from scratch. Stumbled a lot along the way, but definitely picked up many valuable lessons surrounding web development in general.",
//         "The biggest one though, would be getting a taste first-hand of the saying “Software Engineers have to learn fast”. The more I learn, the more I realise I have yet to learn. As I expand the area of my knowledge, the circumference of the unknown just keeps expanding. There is no way I am going to master this before I leave university. There is only one way forward — learn quick and remain adaptable on the job. New frameworks are popping up everyday and I dont see myself mastering any of them. Not because I am not capable of it, but why would I? I hope to solve business and social problems, not master a framework for the sake of mastery. I just need to know enough to get the job done, and pray to the gods of abstraction that everything beneath the layer I comprehend works as expected. Hence, being able to learn fast and not give up when facing obstacles is a key takeaway for me moving forward.",
//         "Furthermore, finding happiness in that grueling process of overcoming obstacles is key to not giving up. Willpower can only take us so far. But if we are not even bothered by the process required to overcome the obstacles, and if we find a way to enjoy that process, that becomes one less burden off our chest. One less thing draining our finite energy. One step closer to having a positive outlook on work and life."
